1. Creating and Renaming Files/Directories 

Create a directory named test_dir using mkdir. 
Inside test_dir, create an empty file called example.txt. 
Rename example.txt to renamed_example.txt using mv 

Commands: 
mkdir test_dir 
cd test_dir 
touch example.txt 
mv example.txt renamed_example.txt 

Explanation: 
- mkdir test_dir creates a new directory. 
- touch example.txt creates an empty file. 
- mv example.txt renamed_example.txt renames the file.

2. Viewing File Contents 
Use cat to display the contents of /etc/passwd. 
Display only the first 5 lines of /etc/passwd using head. 
Display only the last 5 lines of /etc/passwd using tail. 

Commands: 
cat /etc/passwd 
head -n 5 /etc/passwd 
tail -n 5 /etc/passwd 

Explanation: 
cat displays entire file. 
head -n 5 shows first 5 lines. 
tail -n 5 shows last 5 lines.

3.Searching for Patterns 
Use grep to find all lines containing the word "root" in /etc/passwd. 

Command: 
grep "root" /etc/passwd 

Explanation: - 
grep "root" searches for the word "root" in the file. 

---------------------- 

4. Zipping and Unzipping 
Compress the test_dir directory into a file named test_dir.zip using zip. 
Unzip test_dir.zip into a new directory named unzipped_dir. 

Commands: 
cd .. 
zip -r test_dir.zip test_dir 
unzip test_dir.zip -d unzipped_dir 

Explanation: 
zip -r compresses the directory recursively. 
unzip -d extracts it to a new folder. 

-------------------------- 

5. Downloading Files Use wget to download a file from a URL (e.g., https://example.com/sample.txt). 

Command: 
wget https://example.com/sample.txt 

Explanation: 
wget downloads files from the internet.

6. Changing Permissions 
Create a file named secure.txt and change its permissions to read-only for everyone using chmod. 

Commands: 
touch secure.txt 
chmod 444 secure.txt 

Explanation: 
chmod 444 sets read-only permissions for user, group, and others.

7. Working with Environment Variables
