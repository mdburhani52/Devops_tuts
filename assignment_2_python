1. Grade Checker 
Take a score as input and print the grade based on the following: 
90+ : "A" 
80-89 : "B" 
70-79 : "C" 
60-69 : "D" 
Below 60 : "F" 
here we used a basic if else statement to carry out marks and all.


Answer - 

score = int(input("Enter your score: ")) 

if score >= 90: 
  print("Grade: A") 
elif score >= 80: 
  print("Grade: B") 
elif score >= 70: 
  print("Grade: C") 
elif score >= 60: 
  print("Grade: D") 
else: 
  print("Grade: F")

2 Student Grades 
Create a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are their grades. 
Allow the user to: Add a new student and grade. 

Update an existing studentâ€™s grade. 
Print all student grades. 

Used dictionary and basic operations. Using if else:

Answer -

student_grades = {} 

while True: 
  print("\nOptions:") 
  print("1. Add new student and grade") 
  print("2. Update existing student's grade") 
  print("3. Print all student grades") 
  print("4. Exit") 

  choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ") 
  
  if choice == '1': 
    name = input("Enter student name: ") 
    if name in student_grades: 
      print("Student already exists. Use update option.") 
    else: 
      grade = input("Enter grade: ") 
      student_grades[name] = grade 
      print("Student added.") 

  elif choice == '2': 
    name = input("Enter student name to update: ") 
    if name in student_grades: 
      grade = input("Enter new grade: ") 
      student_grades[name] = grade 
      print("Grade updated.") 
    else: 
      print("Student not found.") 

  elif choice == '3': 
    print("\nStudent Grades:") 
    for name, grade in student_grades.items(): 
      print(f"{name}: {grade}") 

  elif choice == '4': 
    print("Exiting...") 
    break 

  else: 
    print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

3.Write to a File 
Write a program to create a text file and write some content to it. 
Using file functions like write and open. 

Answer- 

file_name = "hello.txt" 
with open(file_name, 'w') as file: 
  file.write("Hello! This is a sample file.\n") 
  file.write("Writing data to a file in Python is easy!\n") 
print(f"Content written to {file_name}")


-----------------------------------


4. Read from a File 
We used open in read mode and file.read to read and print to display. 

Answer- 

file_name = "sample.txt" 

try: 
  with open(file_name, 'r') as file: 
    content = file.read() 
    print("File content:\n") 
    print(content) 
except FileNotFoundError: 
  print(f"The file {file_name} does not exist.")
